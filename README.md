# smolVideo

A skeletal clone of [8mb.video](https://8mb.video/) made with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) and [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) based off of [discord-video](https://github.com/Czechball/discord-video). Depending on how good the computer you're running this on is, compressing your video might take a while, so hold tight and don't close your tab, as we don't store the processed video at all.

# Deployment
```

poetry run python main.py
```
